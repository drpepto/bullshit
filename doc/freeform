Step 1 - Agent comes up. It looks for ip address. DNS. Hardcoded.

Step 2 - Agent announces itself to core channel. It waits 1 min for
response. If no response, Agent declares himself the cheese pope and
initiates the cheese pope protocol. If agent gets response, it syncs
the block headers.

Step 3 - Agent requests latest timestamp.

Step 4 - Agent synchronizes self to latest timestamp and then begins
sending off liar requests.

Timestamp protocol.

Step 1 - Generate two sets of 30 random values, set A and set B. Send
both sets to the liar channel.

Step 2 - Receive everyone elses liars requests on the same channel.

Step 3 - Sort the requests, process them and rejects the invalid ones.

Step 4 - rebroadcast all validated sets in a consensus broadcast.

Step 5 - Open the new timestamp period with the first value from set A
(A0). Begin processing transactions in A0. When A0 expires, mark it
closed and open B0. Begin processing transactions in B0. For X
seconds, agent may send in laggard transactions on A0. After the
timeout, A0 is marked closed and the sets contents hashed. The output
hash is fed into B0 while B0 is still open. When B0 expires, A1 is
opened and transactions processed against it. B0 is then allowed the
small grace period for laggards transactions after which it is closed,
hashed and the results fed into A1. This process is repeated for all
30 items in both sets.

Step 6 - When the 15th set is processed, a new 30 random values are
requested for the next period.

Can we do the same thing with just 2 sets? A0 and B0?

Step 1 - Generate A0 and B0.
Step 2 - Agree to A0 and B0.
Step 3 - Create timeStampAgreement and broadcast.
Step 4 -

Election = 1 Timestamp Block = 1 Liar Block = 60 Timestamps = 60 Lies.
